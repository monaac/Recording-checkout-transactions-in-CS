In this code, a Transaction class is defined to store information about a transaction, including the item name, item price, quantity, and total amount (calculated as the product of item price and quantity). The Main method provides a menu with three options: record transaction, view transactions, and exit. If the user selects the first option, the program prompts for information about the transaction and adds a new Transaction object to the transactions list. If the user selects the second option, the program displays the transaction history and the total amount. If the user selects the third option, the program terminates.
